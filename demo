Lactase: Digest the Milky Way

1: Attention and authenticity

"Who has a vacation planned somewhere interesting later this year?"
(if Mars, ask whether someone going somewhere terrestrial?)
"And what day does your vacation start?"

"thank you"

In NYC, there aren't many opportunities to see the night sky. So, when you are
out traveling the world, it's doubly important to get the best possible shot of
the stars... for your InstaSnap feed, or whatever.

2: What is the problem?

I'd like to demo a way of bringing the wonderful OpenSpace technology to the
masses and show a practical way of planning your in-real-life interactions with
our world and the universe surrounding it.

3: The big idea

Users are currently familiar with looking down at a map of Earth. The big idea
here is to connect the experience that people are already used to and get them a
tool that helps make it easier to look up.

4: Impact and your needs

Hopefully we will inspire more people to travel to places where they can explore
nature and think about the universe. Tools like OpenSpace provide us with access
to the necessary data to make the universe more accessible. The only thing left
to do is to polish it up. The only code used here was to make the demo slightly
smoother.


"As some of you know, even on the clearest night you won't have a chance to see the milky way. With OpenSpace it's simple to  Will I have a chance to see the milky way?"

# When? Ask the audience
# Where? 

+ Go to the location (iceland?)
  - via google maps ? (kind of works)
+ Display on two nodes
* Loop the view from sunset to sunrise
+ Go to the time (2018-11-27)
* limit / expand the FOV on the MilkyWay
* Will the moon be there
